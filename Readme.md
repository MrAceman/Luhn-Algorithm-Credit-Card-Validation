## Luhn Algorithm - Credit Card Validation

This HTML, CSS, and JS was created on August 2nd, 2016.  

The goal of this project was practice with logic and algorithms.

The primary purpose of this exercise was to:

1. Write an implementation of the Luhn Algorithm in JavaScript.

[Luhn's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm)

(See attached luhns-algorithm.jpg in project for quick explanation of this algorithm)

NOTE: This project has been deployed with a placeholder credit card number.  This is a fictitious card number that will result in a valid credit card test.

This project has been deployed to Surge at: http://tiy-niclaswillems-luhn-algorithm.surge.sh
